           <h3>>The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631
            To be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal
             who died on 17 June that year while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.
             Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.

        <h3>
            The Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time
             the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites.
             The configuration of mountains in Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites.
             This made Petra a stopping ground for merchants, making it an outstanding area for trade. 
             Things that were traded here included wines, olive oil, and wood.
